# Stock-Project

Twitter is one of the biggest platform where public opinions are expressed. Every day, millions of opinions are published online and amongst these there will be opinions about stocks which can influence the stock market. Our goal is to use Sentimental Analysis on tweets to indicate if a tweet is a positive or negative opinion. 

In short, this document explains how the data from Twitter was collected and assigned a sentimental analysis value.
